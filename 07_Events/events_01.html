<!-- 

    In js, whatever events runs most of them runs sequentially only. However there
    are some exceptions, like browser events.
    These events are actually all the activities  perform on a browser - such as
    clicking on something or moving mouse pointer, drag and drop, using keyboard
    etc... based on these all this async events run,

    To hanlde these events, there are some ways ---

    onClick --- this event are something it happens when we click on some element, 
                it perfoms a task. 
                However there are some problems in it, as in this event we don't get
                much information about this event.
                That's why we should be using even listners, beacuse not only they give 
                the onClick functionality but also they give the ability of 
                propagation.

                Thus we will opt for a better approach.
    
    addEventListner --- this gives us many information about many events, which we can
                        use as per our needs, which makes it really pwoerful. 
                        Events like click, hover, drag, drop - many such events are
                        captured by it.

                        A sample of an eventListner is --
                        document.getElementById('owl').addEventListener('click', function() {}, false);

                        Where first we mention which event we want to capture, here it is 'click'.
                        Then we add our call back function, and in the end we add a 3rd param, which 
                        is "false" -- it is the default value ( so we can ignore it while writing ).
                        
                        However the "false" we write in the end, we should know why it is there. 

                        The events we need to know about ---
                        1. type ( keyboard / mouse type events ), timeStap ( track the time when activities were done ),
                            defaultPrevented ( changing the default behaviour of any action - such as stop submiting the 
                            form or stop the navigation after clicking on an anchor tag )
                        2. target, toElement, srcElement, currentTarget
                        3. clientX, clientY, offsetX, offsetY, screenX, screenY
                        4. altKey, ctrlKey, shiftKey, keyCode

    eventPropagation --- Event propagation is a concept in JavaScript that describes how events 
                            are handled in the Document Object Model (DOM) tree.
    
                            This have main two contexts - event bubbling and event capturing.
                            The default event propagation is event bubbling, which is the
                            "false" we add in the end of addEventListener( '' , function... , false);

                            If we keep it false, it will go with event bubbline.
                            If we keep it true, it will go with event capturing.

                            Even bubbline -- means, traveling from target to root. So if we have an outer element
                                            which is of "image" id, and inside that we have an inner element of 
                                            "japan" id, and if we click on "japan", then first it will capture the 
                                            inner element and then the outer one.

                            Event capturing -- means, traveling from root to target. So if we have an outer element
                                            which is of "image" id, and inside that we have an inner element of 
                                            "japan" id, and if we click on "japan", then first it will capture the 
                                            outer element and then the inner one.

                            Now sometimes we don't want our events to be propagated, which means if we click on any 
                            inner element, it should not go to any outer element -- both in the case of bubbling and
                            capturing.
                            For that we can use " e.stopPropagation() " -- to stop propagation.

                            it will be like:
                            document.getElementById('japan').addEventListener('click', function(e){
                                console.log("japan reached.");
                                e.stopPropagation();
                            }, false);
    
    preventDefault --- Sometimes we want to prevent a default behaviour of any element like an anchor tag.
                            Let's say we don't want it to open the link when clicked on it. So basically here
                            we are having an event whenever the link is clicked. To stop this event, we have --
                            " e.preventDefault() ".

                            It will be like -- 
                            document.getElementById('google').addEventListener('click', function(e){
                                console.log("google clicked.");
                                e.preventDefault();
                            }, false);
