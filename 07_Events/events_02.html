<!-- 

    setTimeOut() -- This is not a part of real javascript, as whenever we call this function
                    an API call runs, and based on the given params, it will execute.

                    What this method does, is we give it a callback function and a time in the end 
                    of this method, and after that particular time the function will be executed. 
                    But this will be executed only once. 
                    So if we ask to log something after 2 sec, then after 2 sec it will log it.

    setInterval() -- This is also kinda same like SetTimeOut(), only difference is that it keeps
                            on running after the time we have mentioned.

                        So in this method also we give a callback function and a time in the end, and
                        every interval of that time, it will be executing the function. So the exectution
                        is continous.

                        If we ask it to log something in 3 sec, in each 3 sec it will keep on logging
                        that thing.

    Now if we want to stop it as per our need, or maybe the method didn't ran properly and we need to stop it
    then there are some other methods as well.
    
    clearTimeOut() -- If there is a setTimeOut() in our code and in any particular event we want to stop it,
                        then we can give reference of that setTimeOUt() to thie method and whenever the SetTimeOut()
                        is going to execute it will stop it.

    clearTimeInterval() -- This method we use to stop the setInterval() method.
