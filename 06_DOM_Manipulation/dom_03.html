    /*
    Some information about optimization:

    The div.innerText = "Dom aur JavaScript" -- is not so optimized because
    what it does is it overwrites the available value. So if there is already some 
    value available, it will bring those values and then set these new values.
    
    While the setAttribute() doesn't actually brings those existing values,
    it directly sets those values in place of the existing ones.

    And because the innterText or innerHTML brings the values and then changes it,
    the process becomes longer, hence less optimized.


    Instead we can do this ---
        const textNode = document.createTextNode = "Chai aur JavaScript";

        Here we are not getting those existing values, instead we are creating our own
        text node.
        And then we will append it in the div.

        div.appendChild(textNode);

        Now in the second process also we are doing it in two steps - first we are creating the
        text node and then we are appending it to the div.
    */

    // attaching the div in the body
    document.body.appendChild(div);

    /*
    Now that we have our own div object, we can wrap it inside a function
    and use it anywhere we want to.
    Also the div id, attributes, color, bg color --- all these things we can 
    pass as arguments and customize it as we want or use a loop on it.
